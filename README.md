# Callback_hell
A simple insight to what a callback hell looks like
Now , this may look a very simple , silly and a waste of time to look at code , but believe me when i say that for a beginner this is the best code to understand what a callback hell looks like.

this code should be installed and run in live server and see the changes in the web page , this is exactly why advanced topics like promises , async/await are developed , to make this code more readable and accessible...

the part of the code where .then() is used is the most tricky , because here i have very very few loc but what if you have like 30 or 40 conditions to run in such condition... the braces , semi-colons and other very small details can create a huge issue and be tedious to solve for a developer , so to make it easier async/await is used . (will post it in next repo.)
